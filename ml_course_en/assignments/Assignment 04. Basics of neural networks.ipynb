    "\n",
    "Before performing the practical work, you need download the data set accordingly to the option on your machine\n",
    "1. Write a program that splits the original sample into a training set and a test set (training set, validation set, test set)\n",
    "2. Build a model using Perceptron (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron.html) and MLPClassifier (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html). On the basis of experiments, select values for learning rate, the regularization parameter, the optimization function.\n",
    "3. Build learning curves for better explanation of your experiments.\n",
