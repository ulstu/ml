## Grading

Final grade depends on two parts: assignment score and final testing score.

Assignment score depends on the number of completed assignments:
* Assignment score 4: 1, 2, 4, 5.1
* Assignment score 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.1, 5.2
* Assignment score 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.1, 5.2, 6
* Assignment score 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.1, 5.2, 6, 7.1, 7.2
