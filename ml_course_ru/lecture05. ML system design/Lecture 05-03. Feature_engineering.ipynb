    "# Lecture 05. Feature Engineering and Feature Selection\n",
    "In this course, we have already seen several key machine learning algorithms. However, before moving on to the more fancy ones, we’d like to take a small detour and talk about data preparation. The well-known concept of “garbage in — garbage out” applies 100% to any task in machine learning. Any experienced professional can recall numerous times when a simple model trained on high-quality data was proven to be better than a complicated multi-model ensemble built on data that wasn’t clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, I wanted to review three similar but different tasks:\n",
    "* **feature extraction** and **feature engineering**: transformation of raw data into features suitable for modeling;\n",
    "* **feature transformation**: transformation of data to improve the accuracy of the algorithm;\n",
    "* **feature selection**: removing unnecessary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will contain almost no math, but there will be a fair amount of code. Some examples will use the dataset from Renthop company, which is used in the [Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries). The file `train.json` is also kept [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_lqydkMrmyNAgG4vU4wVmp6-j7tV0XI8) as `renthop_train.json.gz` (so do unpack it first). In this task, you need to predict the popularity of a new rental listing, i.e. classify the listing into three classes: `['low', 'medium' , 'high']`. To evaluate the solutions, we will use the log loss metric (the smaller, the better). Those who do not have a Kaggle account, will have to register; you will also need to accept the rules of the competition in order to download the data.\n",

    "Text is a type of data that can come in different formats; there are so many text processing methods that cannot fit in a single article. Nevertheless, we will review the most popular ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working with text, one must tokenize it. Tokenization implies splitting the text into units (hence, tokens). Most simply, tokens are just the words. But splitting by word can lose some of the meaning -- \"Santa Barbara\" is one token, not two, but \"rock'n'roll\" should not be split into two tokens. There are ready-to-use tokenizers that take into account peculiarities of the language, but they make mistakes as well, especially when you work with specific sources of text (newspapers, slang, misspellings, typos).\n",
    "\n",
    "After tokenization, you will normalize the data. For text, this is about stemming and/or lemmatization; these are similar processes used to process different forms of a word. One can read about the difference between them [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that we have turned the document into a sequence of words, we can represent it with vectors. The easiest approach is called Bag of Words: we create a vector with the length of the vocabulary, compute the number of occurrences of each word in the text, and place that number of occurrences in the appropriate position in the vector. The process described looks simpler in code:"

This approach is called TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), which cannot be written in a few lines, so you should look into the details in references such as [this wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).

If your task is to just vectorize the image (for example, to use some non-network classifier), you only need to remove the last layers and use the output from the previous layers:"

    "The lognormal distribution is suitable for describing salaries, price of securities, urban population, number of comments on articles on the internet, etc. However, to apply this procedure, the underlying distribution does not necessarily have to be lognormal; you can try to apply this transformation to any distribution with a heavy right tail. Furthermore, one can try to use other similar transformations, formulating their own hypotheses on how to approximate the available distribution to a normal. Examples of such transformations are [Box-Cox transformation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html) (logarithm is a special case of the Box-Cox transformation) or [Yeo-Johnson transformation](https://gist.github.com/mesgarpour/f24769cd186e2db853957b10ff6b7a95) (extends the range of applicability to negative numbers). In addition, you can also try adding a constant to the feature — `np.log (x + const)`.\n",

Let’s try to look at some real data and test for normality using a less formal method — [Q-Q plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%E2%80%93Q_plot). For a normal distribution, it will look like a smooth diagonal line, and visual anomalies should be intuitively understandable.\n",

    "Not many algorithms can work with missing values, and the real world often provides data with gaps. Fortunately, this is one of the tasks for which one doesn’t need any creativity. Both key python libraries for data analysis provide easy-to-use solutions: [pandas.DataFrame.fillna](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html) and [sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#imputation).\n",
    "\n",
    "These solutions do not have any magic happening behind the scenes. Approaches to handling missing values are pretty straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "* encode missing values with a separate blank value like `\"n/a\"` (for categorical variables);\n",
    "* use the most probable value of the feature (mean or median for the numerical variables, the most common value for categorical variables);\n",
    "* or, conversely, encode with some extreme value (good for decision-tree models since it allows the model to make a partition between the missing and non-missing values);\n",
    "* for ordered data (e.g. time series), take the adjacent value — next or previous.\n",

    "Why would it even be necessary to select features? To some, this idea may seem counterintuitive, but there are at least two important reasons to get rid of unimportant features. The first is clear to every engineer: the more data, the higher the computational complexity. As long as we work with toy datasets, the size of the data is not a problem, but, for real loaded production systems, hundreds of extra features will be quite tangible. The second reason is that some algorithms take noise (non-informative features) as a signal and overfit.\n",

If we build on this thought, it is reasonable to say that features with low variance are worse than those with high variance. So, one can consider cutting features with variance below a certain threshold."
